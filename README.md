## Comprehensive Asteroid Report from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

This project is an experiment in web design with Flask, using Python, HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
The website that this code actualizes may be found here: https://asteroidticker.herokuapp.com/. <br />

The website organizes and makes comprehensible available National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory data from the
Close Approach Database. <br />

Here you can see a list of asteroids that passed near the Earth within your settings for total lunar distances (LD) from Earth and number of days within a selected time window.
